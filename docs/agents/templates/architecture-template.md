## 🚀 Technical Implementation Details

### Cache Implementation
```typescript
// Example cache configuration
const cacheConfig = {
  executiveDashboard: {
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false
  },
  analyticsDashboard: {
    staleTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes  
    cacheTime: 20 * 60 * 1000, // 20 minutes
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false
  }
}
```

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Example stored procedure implementation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_executive_dashboard_data()
RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
    result JSON;
BEGIN
    -- Optimized query combining multiple metrics
    SELECT json_build_object(
        'total_revenue', (SELECT SUM(final_amount) FROM sales WHERE status = 'completed' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'),
        'total_sales', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE status = 'completed' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'),
        'active_customers', (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM sales WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'),
        'pending_deliveries', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales WHERE status = 'pending' AND delivery = true)
    ) INTO result;
    
    RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
