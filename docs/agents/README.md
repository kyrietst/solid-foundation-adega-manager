## 🔄 Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Analysis 📊
**Agent:** `adega-data-analyst`
**Output:** `docs/agents/analysis/performance-analysis-[date].md`
**Purpose:** Deep system analysis identifying bottlenecks, patterns, and optimization opportunities

**Key Deliverables:**
- Quantified performance bottlenecks
- Database fragmentation analysis  
- User segmentation requirements
- Specific optimization recommendations
- CLAUDE.md update requirements

### Phase 2: Implementation 🏗️
**Agent:** `adega-architect` 
**Output:** `docs/agents/architecture/implementation-log-[date].md`
**Purpose:** Implement optimizations and architectural improvements based on analysis

**Key Deliverables:**
- Performance optimizations implemented
- New architectural patterns
- UI/UX improvements
- Measured performance improvements
- CLAUDE.md updates completed

### Phase 3: Documentation Updates 📋
**Both Agents**
**Output:** Updated `CLAUDE.md` + implementation docs
**Purpose:** Ensure system documentation reflects current reality

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- **2025-09-06**: Performance analysis completed by Data Analyst
  - **Critical Finding**: COGS calculation causing 2-3s delay
  - **Database Issue**: 89% fragmentation in profiles table  
  - **Volume Correction**: System has 1,310+ records (not 925 as documented)
  - **Recommendation**: 70% performance improvement possible

### 🔄 Next Steps  
- **Architect Implementation**: Address critical bottlenecks
- **Dashboard Segregation**: Executive vs Analytics dashboards
- **UI Optimization**: Remove fluid blob animations
- **Cache Strategy**: Multi-layer caching implementation

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked

### Performance Baselines (Pre-Optimization)
- **Dashboard Load Time**: 4-7 seconds
- **Query Count**: 8-12 per dashboard load
- **Database Fragmentation**: 89% in profiles table
- **COGS Calculation**: 2,000-3,000ms

### Performance Targets (Post-Optimization)
- **Executive Dashboard**: <2 seconds load time
- **Analytics Dashboard**: <5 seconds load time  
- **Query Reduction**: 75% fewer database calls
- **COGS Optimization**: <400ms calculation time

## 🛠️ Templates Available

### For Data Analysts
**Template:** `templates/analysis-template.md`
